## Game logic:
-Each player can roll the dice and get more scores added to their current score, but if a player1 gets a score of 1 their score is set back to zero and the game switches to player2.

-to add the current score to the total score just click the "Hold" button.

-if a player's total score reaches 100 they win!

-restart button restarts the game!.
